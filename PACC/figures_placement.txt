The rule of thumb (do this)
	•	Don’t typeset equations inside figure captions (most journals dislike it).
	•	Do: put each equation in the Theoretical Framework section, immediately before or after the figure that visualizes it, and refer to the figure in the sentence introducing the equation.
	•	In Methods/Results, cite the equations and figures again when you show data.

Figure–Equation map (what goes where)

Fig. 1 — Skewed aperture geometry & coordinates

Panels:
(a) Global vs aperture frame; yaw (φ), pitch (ψ).
(b) Shear (κx, κy) shown on the aperture edges.
(c) Solid-angle cone seen by the aperture.

Equation placed with this figure: Eq. (6) Escape flux integral
	•	Placement: In the subsection “Escape integral,” introduce Fig. 1, then display Eq. (6) right after the first paragraph describing the geometry.
	•	Caption (template):
Fig. 1. Skewed aperture geometry and coordinate frames used to evaluate the escape flux in Eq. (6): (a) yaw φ and pitch ψ, (b) shear κx, κy, (c) aperture solid-angle view.

In-text cue (Word):
“Figure 1 defines the rotated/sheared aperture and its solid-angle view. The transmitted illuminance is given by the escape integral in Eq. (6).”

Fig. 2 — Seven-source anisotropic ambient basis

Panels:
(a) Hemispherical lobe diagram with 7 directional sources (zenith + 6 azimuthal).
(b) Table inset with I_i, \theta_i, T_i (example values).

Equation placed with this figure: Eq. (8) Discrete seven-source sum
	•	Placement: Subsection “Anisotropic ambient decomposition”—reference Fig. 2, then present Eq. (8).
	•	Caption:
Fig. 2. Seven-direction basis used to approximate ambient anisotropy (Eq. 8). Zenith source captures high-angle diffuse; six lateral sectors cover the horizon.

In-text cue:
“As illustrated in Fig. 2, we approximate the hemisphere with seven sources; the predicted illuminance sums as in Eq. (8).”

Fig. 3 — Glint geometry & gain

Panels:
(a) Incidence angle θ on a glossy/glazing surface; grazing regime highlighted.
(b) Plot of G_{\text{glint}}(\theta)=1+F_0(\sec\theta-1) vs θ with F_0 examples.
(c) (Optional) Photo/diagram of a measured glint stripe.

Equation placed with this figure: Eq. (9) Fresnel-style glint gain (and optional (9a) combined form)
	•	Placement: Subsection “Glint amplification”—introduce Fig. 3, then display Eq. (9); if you use the split-sum form that applies gain only to glint-active directions, show Eq. (9a) immediately after.
	•	Caption:
Fig. 3. Glint geometry and angular gain (Eq. 9). Grazing incidence increases reflectance/gain, elevating contributions for glint-active directions.

In-text cue:
“Fig. 3 shows the grazing-angle amplification; we model it with Eq. (9), applied to the subset \mathcal{G} (Eq. 9a).”

Fig. 4 — Real-world modifiers (occlusion/reflectance/transmissivity)

Panels:
(a) Recess depth and wall occlusion schematic.
(b) Angle-dependent transmissivity T_i(\theta) example.
(c) Internal reflectance bounce sketch.
(d) Bar chart of fitted M_k for a scenario.

Equation placed with this figure: Eq. (7) Multiplicative modifiers
	•	Placement: Subsection “Empirical modifiers”—refer to Fig. 4’s mechanisms, then present Eq. (7).
	•	Caption:
Fig. 4. Physical effects represented by modifiers in Eq. (7): wall occlusion, glazing/transmissivity, and internal reflectance.

In-text cue:
“As in Fig. 4, recess and material effects are captured by multiplicative factors M_k in Eq. (7).”

Methods/Results figures (equations are cited, not displayed)

Fig. 5 — Experimental setup photo
	•	Bench, coil/PSU/buck modules, sensors, aperture rig labeled.
	•	Text: cite Eqs. (6)–(9) as the predictive core the bench tests.

Fig. 6 — Illuminance: predicted vs measured
	•	Scatter with 1:1 line, MAPE, R^2, error bars.
	•	Text: “Predictions use Eq. (8) with modifiers Eq. (7); geometry per Eq. (6); glint per Eq. (9) when applicable.”

Fig. 7 — Thermal: predicted vs measured
	•	Similar scatter or time series to steady state.
	•	Text: cite Eq. (6)/(8) analog for thermal (or note reuse of the same directional framework with H_i, T_i^{(\text{thermal})}) and modifiers Eq. (7).

Fig. 8 — Acoustic: predicted vs measured
	•	SPL comparison; note angle-dependent damping factor (your D(\theta,\phi) described in text).
	•	Text: cite the discrete sum analogy and geometry per Fig. 1; no new equation needed here.

Fig. 9 — Combined scenario
	•	Bar or radar chart showing light/∆T/SPL predicted vs measured for one geometry.
	•	Text: explicitly cite all four equations as the superposition recipe.

Concrete placement recipe (Word)
	1.	Theory section layout (the four key pairs):
	•	Paragraph introducing Fig. 1 → insert Fig. 1 (caption) → next paragraph ends with “given by Eq. (6)” → display Eq. (6).
	•	Paragraph introducing Fig. 2 → insert Fig. 2 → next paragraph → display Eq. (8).
	•	Paragraph introducing Fig. 3 → insert Fig. 3 → next paragraph → display Eq. (9) (+ 9a if used).
	•	Paragraph introducing Fig. 4 → insert Fig. 4 → next paragraph → display Eq. (7).
	2.	Cross-refs: Use Word’s References → Cross-reference to insert “Eq. (6)”/“Fig. 1” links everywhere you mention them.
	3.	Captions: Keep captions descriptive but short; no equations inside captions. End captions with “… used in Eq. (6)/(8)/(9)” if you want an extra pointer.
